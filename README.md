## 13. chmod
Changes the permissions of a file or directory. Example: chmod 755 script.sh sets read/write/execute permissions.

## 14. chown
Changes the owner of a file or directory. Example: chown user:group file.txt changes the owner of file.txt.

## 15. find
Searches for files or directories in a directory hierarchy. Example: find /home -name "*.txt" finds all .txt files in /home.

## 16. grep
Searches text using patterns. Example: grep "pattern" file.txt searches for the string “pattern” in file.txt.

## 17. ps
Displays currently running processes. Example: ps aux shows a detailed list of running processes.

## 18. top
Displays real-time system processes and resource usage, such as CPU and memory.

## 19. kill
Terminates processes by their PID (Process ID). Example: kill 1234 terminates the process with PID 1234.

## 20. df
Shows disk space usage for file systems. Example: df -h displays it in human-readable format (e.g., GB).

## 21. du
Shows disk usage of files and directories. Example: du -sh /home/user/ gives the total size of /home/user/.

## 22. tar
Archives and compresses files. Example: tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2 creates a tar archive, while tar -xvf archive.tar extracts it.

## 23. wget
Downloads files from the internet. Example: wget http://example.com/file.zip downloads file.zip from the given URL.

## 24. curl
Transfers data from or to a server using various protocols. Example: curl http://example.com fetches the web page from the URL.

## 25. man
Displays the manual for a command. Example: man ls shows the manual page for the ls command.

## 26. sudo
Runs commands with superuser (root) privileges. Example: sudo apt-get update runs apt-get update with root privileges.

## 27. apt-get
Installs, updates, and manages packages on Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu). Example: sudo apt-get install package_name.

## 28. yum
Package manager for RPM-based distributions like Fedora or CentOS. Example: sudo yum install package_name.

## 29. ssh
Connects to a remote server via Secure Shell. Example: ssh user@server.com connects to the server as user.

## 30. hostname
Displays or sets the system's hostname. Example: hostname shows the current hostname, and hostname newhostname changes it to newhostname.
